# Responsive-Portfolio-Project

* Created the following files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

Each file has the following:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images


An HTML validation service was used to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

## Home Page

* Shows my biography and about me as well as gives links to my linkedin profile and github repository. There is also a link to a word document for my up-to-date resume.

## Portfolio Page

* shows my 3 latest projects and gives the github repository links as well as the URL to the applications. It also gives a brief description of each project.

## Contact Page

* allows users to contact me with a brief message.
