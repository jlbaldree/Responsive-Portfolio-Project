        <p>My name is Jonathan Baldree. I was born in Tacoma, Washington but grew up mostly in the San Diego, California area. I moved to Utah in 2007 and now live in Tooele.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently working at Optum Bank as an operations processor servicing health savings accounts. I have worked there for almost 4 years and am ready for something more challenging and fulfilling. I've recently enrolled in a coding bootcamp program at the University of Utah and am hoping to gain some valuable skills in order to pursue another career path.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy camping and spending time with my family. We've undertaken remodeling our basement so I'm also spending a lot of time working on that and various automobile projects. My wife and I have also grown our family this year welcoming a little girl at the end of August. She and my 7 year old keep us busy and entertained.</p>
